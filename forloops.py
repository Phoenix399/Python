# For loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times
# You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc

# Example loops (uncomment one to test):

# for x in range(1, 1001):
#     print(x)

# for x in reversed(range(1, 11)):
#     print(x)

# for x in range(1, 12, 2):
#     print(x)


#credit_card_ = input("Enter your credit card number: ")
#for x in credit_card_:
   # print(x)
for x in range(1, 21):
    if x == 13:
        continue   # skip 13
    else:
        print(x)
